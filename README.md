## 🧠 How the Modals Work

* `AuthModalManager.tsx` controls which modal (Login or Sign Up) is active.
* The **“Login”** text at the bottom of the Sign Up modal switches to the Login modal, and vice versa.
* All modals are fully responsive and click-outside-to-close is supported.

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* [ ] Integrate actual authentication (e.g., Firebase / Supabase / custom API)
* [ ] Add form validation and error handling
* [ ] Animate modal transitions more smoothly
* [ ] Add dark mode support
