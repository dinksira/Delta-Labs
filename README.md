This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 🚀

## 🧠 How the Modals Work

* `AuthModalManager.tsx` controls which modal (Login or Sign Up) is active.
* The **“Login”** text at the bottom of the Sign Up modal switches to the Login modal, and vice versa.
* All modals are fully responsive and click-outside-to-close is supported.

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* [ ] Integrate actual authentication (e.g., Firebase / Supabase / custom API)
* [ ] Add form validation and error handling
* [ ] Animate modal transitions more smoothly
* [ ] Add dark mode support

Would you like me to include **badges** (like `npm`, `Next.js`, `build passing`, etc.) at the top of the README too?  
It gives a nice “open-source” polish 👌
